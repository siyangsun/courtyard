title: The Courtyard
---

>In the centre of the web, at the perfect location of cosmic time, the crossroads of the city, lies a palace. It does not look grand. It does not look like anything special; just a red house in Marrakesh. And in it is a courtyard. And inside that is a grey-faced emir, who is smiling, just smiling, sitting on the ground and smiling at a sun that washes over a city that will never die. And he smiles because he knows that utopia is possible, if one only steps, inch by inch, into their own creation.

## Welcome to the courtyard! 

This here is the entrance to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), or [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), or[ crazy wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_board), or web of near-truths, or [eternal labyrinth](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Lord%27s_Labyrinth), or whatever other visual analogy most kindly speaks the concept to you. Though there it has [no walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform), it tries to contain ideas as I have shaped and arranged them to my liking. Some of these paths may connect or intersect in unexpected ways, or they may not.

All roads lead back to here in some way; feel free to explore and loot the knowledge as you desire. 

## What is this place for?
I've been taking scattered notes in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for quite some time now and exploring the power of bidirectional links to discover unanticipated connections between ideas. Many of these ideas I collected ended up collecting dust. I figured I would [open up the garage door](notes/working-with-the-garage-door-open) and let some of that dust blow away.
