Cognitive scaffolding is an educational framework where something helps reduce the cognitive load of a task until the learner is ready to do so without it (I like to think of this as how training wheels help you learn how to ride a bike, or crutches help you start to walk again after an injury). 

Cognitive scaffolding can help remove or overcome immediate obstacles that stop a learner from taking the first step. One way they do this is by eliminating decisions that are temporarily unnecessary, similar to how a [[philosophical razor]] removes explanations to more quickly reach some level of understanding.
