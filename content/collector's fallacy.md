## Collector's fallacy

[Collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/): you really have to work with something to understand it.
Knowing **about** a thing is not the same thing as knowing it.

Collectors don't make progress.

In my own life, this rings true- none of my bookmarked pages have done me any good if I never open them. None of the sample packs or VSTs or photoshop brushes are useful unless I go through them and try using them. Saving tutorial videos (or even watching them) isn't that useful unless I try it for myself or at least take notes. And stray thoughts that I jot down don't tend to go anywhere unless I go out of my way to revisit them, nurture them, and connect them to each other.
