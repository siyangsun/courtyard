that nausea you feel is actually hunger. those shivers are probably a sign that you're wearing too much. sleepiness from oversleeping, exhaustion from lack of exercise.. all of this lethargy is not what you think. wanting to avoid people means you've been too isolated. craving instant dopamine means you need to slow the brain down a bit.

you would benefit from drinking way more water than you feel the urge to. one deep breath is usually not enough. that bleak way you're viewing the world is filtered through all that tension you're unconsciously holding in your face. sometimes you need to turn the lights on; sometimes you need to turn the lights off. sometimes you need more stimulation, sometimes you need to just chill out.
