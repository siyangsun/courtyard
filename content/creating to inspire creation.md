My main goal in making things is to inspire others to make things, potentially in new ways. Maybe someone will see my paintings and think, "I want to learn how to paint like that!" or "I want to incorporate those brushstrokes that into my style!" or even "I want to write a book about the concepts here". 

Other peoples' creations for the sake of creation (media created for the sake of artistry rather than for the sake of a paycheck) often inspire me to make something and break the loop of perpetual consumption. This focus on making output out of input helps avoid the [[collector's fallacy]].

The key to making this happen is to just put stuff out there without regard for established distribution channels and focus on [[working with the garage door open|working with the garage door open]].
