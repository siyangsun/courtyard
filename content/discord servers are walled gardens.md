[[Discord]] servers can act as private message boards for groups of friends or online communities. Due to the chatroom style nature, they are innately unindexed by the web (unlike traditional forums or other social media apps like Reddit). Intuitively this resembles group chats on messaging apps or private conversations between friends.

However when using discord as an educational resource or virtual [[third space]], shared information becomes difficult to access without knowing which servers to join. To make matters more complicated, many servers have private channels or are completely private entirely. If a server is shut down, the information is essentially lost forever. As many hobby communities move to the platform, this kind of information loss is a growing uncertainty as [[internet impermanence]] proliferates.
