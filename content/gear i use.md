## Hardware
- I do most personal stuff on a [Meshlicious](https://ssupd.co/products/meshlicious) 14L SFF PC build with compromises made to fit an RTX3070 (which I barely use) and 2TBs of NVMe storage (which I kind of use).
- I type on a [ZSA moonlander mk I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) split ortho (columnar tilt) keyboard. My [layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/njbZx/latest/0) is basically QWERTY with some minor adjustments, though this is a work in progress and may change in the future as I experiment.
- I use a [2nd gen XP-Pen Artist Pro 22](https://www.xp-pen.com/store/buy/artist-22-2nd-gen.html?gad=1) for digital art. I'm thinking of replacing the screen protector with a paper textured one.
- For my audio monitoring setup I use a pair of [5 inch JBL LSR305](https://jblpro.com/products/lsr305) which uses a [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2) as the interface.
- I usually aspire to have a standing desk, monitor arm, ergonomic chair, etc. though these are fluid with my current living situation.

## Software
- My main PC runs windows. I use MacOS for work when needed.
- For these notes, I use [[obsidian]] for note taking and [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to generate static webpages.
- I produce music with [[bitwig studio]]. I believe it's the [[digital audio workstation]] of the near future.
- I paint on [Corel Painter](https://www.painterartist.com/en/product/painter/?sourceid=ptr2022-xx-ppc_brkws&x-vehicle=ppc_brkws&trial=false). I like the brush engine and physical emulation, although the real reason I use it is because I got it on sale for $25 (watch out for annual sales on humble bundle).
- I also use Microsoft Paint a lot!
