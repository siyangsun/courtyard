Serendipity, even caused by what might seem like a "mistake", can create new scenarios that we may not have otherwise come up with; especially from following a tried-and-true path. This can create [[edge case]] that can break our internal algorithms and force us to think in new ways, or it can push an unknown situation into more familiar territory. What we make out of these happy accidents can be very interesting. This is an example of how [[limitations breed creativity]].
