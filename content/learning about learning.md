The act of learning itself can be thought of as a skill that one can continuously improve at by understanding the cognitive process of learning. This is also known as [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-learning). 

Related metatheory concepts:
- meta-knowledge (knowledge about knowledge)
- meta-memory (memory about memory)
- meta-history, also known as historiography
- meta-philosophy
- meta-mathematics
- meta-ontology

Meta-cognitive concepts can increase in the higher orders as one continues to study the meta-domains (e.g. 2nd order meta-knowledge is knowledge about meta-knowledge).
