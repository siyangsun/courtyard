While learning, many students will keep notes and cheatsheets, which they share between their classmates. This is an example of learning exhaust. These outputs can be a great way to not only reinforce your own learning, but help others who are on the same journey. The exhaust can even circulate, helping those in the future who will eventually want to learn what you learned; the internet further enables this.

Unlike vehicle emissions, producing learning exhaust requires intentioned effort. After exiting school and freeing ourselves from coursework, the default way to learn things is in private. Many of us watch videos, read articles, and maybe occasionally try to make stuff on our own, but never post it because it seems like it'll never take off.

learning in private = grinding skills

learning in public = doing quests

[[doing quests is more rewarding than grinding skills]]

This is one way of [[working with the garage door open]].
