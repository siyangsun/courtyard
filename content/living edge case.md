Some people have lived a life others cannot believe or comprehend. Aside from Guinness world record holders, someone with a rare disease or extremely niche profession has lived a life that's very different from that of the average person.

Some skillsets are also extremely rare in today's age. The making of [Damascus steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_steel), [Greek fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_fire), and [Roman concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete) were famously (and in some cases apocryphally) lost to time. There are languages with only single-digit remaining speakers. Even the count of people who write COBOL is ["expected to decline rapidly"](https://increment.com/programming-languages/cobol-all-the-way-down/#:~:text=Micro%20Focus%20estimates%20that%20about,rapidly%20over%20the%20next%20decade.). To someone (or something, an [[AI is a collage|AI]] trying to gather all knowledge known by humans, the experience of these people would be extremely valuable.
