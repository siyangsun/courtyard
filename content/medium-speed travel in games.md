title: Medium speed travel in games
tags: []

Just like in the physical world, games often involve traversing the game map with different methods. Among these, I'm a fan of what I call medium-speed travel: faster than walking, but not quite as instantaneous as [fast travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_travel).
- extends your range to explore without losing all "weight" or consequence to travel decisions
- different way of experiencing the game world
	- [[granularity of transportation]]
- can feel like public transit, where you get to see other people traveling with you

examples:
- airship in maplestory
- zeppelin in wow
