Most Youtube tutorials often contain unnecessary bloat ("top 5 list" format, excessive monologue, b-roll montages, self-promotion, ad segment) and run at 10+ minutes for revenue reasons, not to mention the clickbait titles and thumbnails making it hard to search a specific technique. This is usually not conducive to learning. 

Sometimes, though, you'll find a 2 minute tutorial with like 114 views that tells you exactly what you needed to know with zero unnecessary information or production value. One specific topic, one specific explanation, video over, thing learned. This is undoubtedly more beneficial in terms of educational content. How could a platform optimize its [[objective function]] to incentivize more of that?
