## Human labor is hidden behind AI

#### Ghost work

Automation won't replace human labor; it will just split what humans currently do into tons of tiny [living edge cases](notes/living-edge-case) that pay a few cents apiece, small enough that handling it won't count as a "real" job and the wealthy class will never see it happen. These tiny jobs are then stitched together into a seamless-looking "fully automated" result that hides the "filthy" human labor in the back room. [AI is a collage](notes/ai-is-a-collage) and the quilt is exploitation of humans and their data.
