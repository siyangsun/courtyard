>We don't make mistakes -- we just have happy accidents.

Serendipity can create new scenarios that an experienced person may not have otherwise come up with. This can create [edge cases](edge-case.md) that can break our internal algorithms and force us to think in new ways, or it can push an unknown situation into more familiar territory. What we make out of these happy accidents can be very interesting.
