title: "Memorization as a cognitive scaffolding"

## Why you should do flashcards / spaced repetition
not to memorize just to memorize, but memorize so that when you see stuff, you can RECOGNIZE and UNDERSTAND it in context - which has a way bigger effect for learning

also good to memorize the first 1000-2000 concepts such that you have a bit of a [cognitive scaffolding](notes/cognitive-scaffolding) to understand context and slot any new things into. This also helps in [training your intuition](notes/training-intuition)

This is true not just for words and language but also for coding languages or mathematical formulae or chemical formulae
