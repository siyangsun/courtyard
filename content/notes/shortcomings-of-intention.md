## Shortcomings of intention
- intention is WHAT someone is thinking when they do an action. for example, i say somethng to you with the intent of starting conversation.
- we must go beyond intention; intention is relatively neutral and boring
- it's more interesting to imagine WHY someone intends to do something. for example, WHY i say this particular thing to you when i intend to start conversation
