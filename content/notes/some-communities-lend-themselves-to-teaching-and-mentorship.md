## Some communities lend themselves towards teaching and mentorship

- generally hobby communities are better about this than "professional" communities
	- e.g. skateboarding vs. "being a lawyer"
	- maybe because professional skills have these learnings gated behind certain hurdles? in this case, law school
	- there are financial incentives for those with the knowledge to withold its free distribution outside of the community
- grassroots hobby communities have better tools for learning / improvement / skill sharing
	- for example, it's SUPER easy for me to learn how to play my death knight better for WoW. there are tons of guides out there that help optimize every tiny little thing, and many measurement tools that give a detailed look at where I can improve. however, these tools are not accessible for something like singing, and online guides tend to be much harder to follow
