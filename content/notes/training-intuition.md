title: "Training your intuition"

Many professionals in various fields have talked about relying on "feeling" over strictly adhering to rules. Rather than using predefined rules for decisionmaking, their approach to learning is to train your intuition. This can be done by just experiencing a large number of data points (e.g. watching tv shows in a new language, skiing down moguls until you figure it out, seeing enough business scenarios). In fact, the intangible quality of having "experience" in something can often compose of a well-developed intuition. 

Although putting in a ton of time and iterations will inevitably build some intuition, there are deliberate ways to do it efficiently. First, starting with [memorization as a cognitive scaffolding](notes/memorization-as-a-cognitive-scaffolding) can provide a head start by laying down the building blocks to work with later. These fundamentals will help create a [low rank approximation](notes/low-rank-approximation) of the skill or field of knowledge. After that, intentionally finding data points that are [edge cases](notes/edge-case) will simulate years of experience. This is similar to how some [machine learning models work](notes/ai-is-a-collage) and can be bolstered with synthesized data.
