[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a free note-taking platform that can construct wiki-style knowledge bases from folders of linked markdown files. One major feature of Obsidian is bidirectional linking, which enables deeper interconnection between ideas.

## How I use Obsidian
- daily notes as a journal + brain dump
- anything lengthy or recurring gets turned its own page and linked to in the day's daily note
- selectively publish here once fleshed out and added links between related articles
#### Syncing
- use remotely-save plugin
- dropbox as a db (might migrate to s3 once i reach storage limit)
