Sometimes we can give a problem enough assumptions (or break it down enough) that it or part of it becomes a [convex optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf) problem. As long as we know the [[objective function]] and the constraints, we can solve these types of problems.
