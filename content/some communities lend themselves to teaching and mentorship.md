- generally hobby communities are better about this than "professional" communities
	- e.g. skateboarding has way fewer formal [[barriers to entry]] vs. "being a lawyer"
		- obviously there are barriers such as physical ability, coordination, access to a skateboard and space to use it, etc.
		- however once you have those, you don't need to prove to anyone else that you're a skater. you can also pretty much do whatever tricks you want as long as it's within your ability to do so.
	- maybe because professional skills have these learnings gated behind certain hurdles that may be legitimate barriers. in this case, law school
	- one could certainly cause more damage to others as an untrained lawyer than as an untrained skateboarder
	- there are financial incentives for those with the knowledge to withold its free distribution outside of the community
- grassroots hobby communities have better tools for learning / improvement / skill sharing
	- for example, it's SUPER easy for me to learn how to play my death knight character better for WoW. there are tons of guides out there on [icy veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/) or other platforms that help optimize every tiny little thing, and many community-built measurement tools that give a detailed look at where I can improve. 
	- however, these tools are not as accessible for something like singing, and online guides tend to be much harder to follow
	- less grassroots communities generally follow a more traditional path of study with schools and teachers (who were themselves trained within established systems with their own barriers to entry) providing private lessons
- communities revolving around skills with more emphasis on "natural ability" may have a reduced capacity for this
