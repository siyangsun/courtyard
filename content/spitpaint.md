A spitpaint is a 30 minute sketch of a set topic. It's kind of like the minimum-viable painting. This can be used for quickly fleshing out ideas, loosening up before a larger painting, or practicing / trying out new techniques. This is an exercise that tries to leverage the fact that [[limitations breed creativity]].

Techniques:
- thumbnailing
- random form search on noisy background
- lasso tool
- perspective grid warp
