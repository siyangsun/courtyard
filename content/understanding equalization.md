Equalization is an important tool in signals processing that lets us control the level of different frequences of a sound.

## Takeaways

#### 1. EQ cuts create definition
- EQ cuts cause separation between parts of the spectrum. This causes parts on either side of the cut to pop out more. 
- This means you can cut on both sides instead of boosting to reach the same effect while giving more headroom to push saturation. 
- You can cut strategically around a region in order to boost that part of the sound even more while retaining clarity

#### 2. Know what part of the sound you do and don't need
- Always consider the sound in context of the mix. A guitar without any EQ cuts in the low mids / mids might sound really good and full on its own, but when mixed in with other melodic elements it can contribute to a muddy mix. 
- Be aware of what the sound is contributing and only keep that part; if adding a sound for timbre, cut out anything but the high end and other elements can fill in the gaps. If adding a sound for tone, keep the fundamental or low harmonics.
- This trick also works when taking a melodic sound and extracting its texture by high passing out the fundamental. This is because the higher harmonics (farther from the fundamental) will be more and more atonal.

## Techniques
- Sweep an EQ cut across the sound while the whole mix plays; cut anything that you didn't notice disappearing
- Turn gain on sound down a lot, then take an EQ and sweep a boost around to see where it should sit in the mix

## Practice strategy
Take a low/high pass filter on white noise or any song, and try to blind guess what frequency range the cut is at. This can help [[training intuition|train intuition]] for what certain frequency ranges sound like.
