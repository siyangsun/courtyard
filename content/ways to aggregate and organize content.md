- unsorted dump (likes)
	- high speed minimal effort
	- no curation -> no story
	- shuffling thru at random is inefficient
- curated lists (playlists)
	- takes the most effort. and can take way way more effort based on how much u wanna curate
	- story/vibe driven to the max. story told with intent
	- highly searchable, relatable, shareable
	- the way the internet has been moving (imo)
- time-based aggregation (similar to monthly playlists or ig photo dump)
	- still pretty low effort
	- personal and eclectic
	- tells a story on accident. can be more genuine as a result!
	- mid-2010s social media was all about this
