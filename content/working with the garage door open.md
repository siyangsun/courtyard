Andy Matuschak uses the phrase [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) to paint a picture of building in public; where one's garage workshop is left open for neighbors and passersby to see and get inspired.
