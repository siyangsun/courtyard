{"/":{"title":"The Courtyard","content":"\n\n\u003eIn the centre of the web, at the perfect location of cosmic time, the crossroads of the city, lies a palace. It does not look grand. It does not look like anything special; just a red house in Marrakesh. And in it is a courtyard. And inside that is a grey-faced emir, who is smiling, just smiling, sitting on the ground and smiling at a sun that washes over a city that will never die. And he smiles because he knows that utopia is possible, if one only steps, inch by inch, into their own creation.\n\nhttps://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4005\n\n## Welcome to the courtyard!\n\nThis here is the entrance to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), or [second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/), or[ crazy wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_board), or web of near-truths, or [eternal labyrinth](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Lord%27s_Labyrinth), or whatever other visual analogy most kindly speaks the concept to you. Though there it has [no walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform), it tries to contain ideas as I have shaped and arranged them to my liking. Some of these paths may connect or intersect in unexpected ways, or they may not. In harmony with the digital gardening ethos, the contents are perpetually under construction to some degree.\n\nMost roads lead back to here in some way; feel free to explore and loot the knowledge as you desire.\n\n## What is this place for?\nI've been taking scattered notes in [[obsidian]] for quite some time now and exploring the power of bidirectional links to discover unanticipated connections between ideas. Many of these ideas I collected ended up collecting dust. I figured I would [[working with the garage door open]] and let some of that dust blow away.\n\n## How do you navigate this site?\nI've found the best way to navigate a digital garden is just how you'd navigate a \"real\" garden - by wandering from room to room based on what seems interesting. This can be done by clicking on any of the internal links throughout each page. There's also a map of the full layout of connected links at the bottom. A benefit of digitization is that you can also directly search for pages or keywords at the top. There are also tags that you can search.\n\n#### Current tags:\n- `hallway:` pages with thoughts that are not fleshed out; might just contain bullets or links to other pages\n- `tent`: ephemeral pages that don't really contain knowledge and may change a lot, contrary to the ethos of [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)\n- `room`: everything else\n\n## Who am I?\nYou can read more about me on my [main site!](https://siyangsun.github.io/)","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.949506004Z","tags":null},"/AI-is-a-collage":{"title":"AI is a collage","content":"\nA [generative adversarial network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) is a type of machine learning framework often used for creating images. \n\n## Thinking of GANs as a collage\n[Dada, Instagram, and the Future of AI/](https://theartofresearch.org/we-are-collage-dada-instagram-and-the-future-of-ai/)\n- collages are Dada 1.0\n- snapchat (filters, AR facemasks) / its clones are Dada 2.0\n- many things are a collage today - video edits, hip hop samples, photoshops\n- a collage is the consumer and the creator combined\n- GANs are the ultimate form of this (generator is the creator, discriminator is the consumer) - Dada 3.0\n- AI generated images are kind of like a super collage of thousands of images\n- Neural nets are just linear combinations\n\n## AI and Democracy \n\n\u003e\"Education is a founding principle of democracy, because a democracy is only as good as its voters, just as any algorithm is only as good as its data.\"\n\n[AI, UBI, and Data](https://theartofresearch.org/ai-ubi-and-data/)\n\nLike a collage or a democracy, AI depends heavily on its source material.

Each of these adventurers will have their own specialized role in the team. Within the typical [MMO Holy Trinity](https://kionay.medium.com/what-is-the-mmo-holy-trinity-85b800fabc3f) we have a tank that gets the attention of the boss and protects the party, damage dealers who try to down the boss as fast as possible, and supportive healers who try to keep everyone else alive. Playing one's own role can be difficult to optimize and have a [[high skill ceiling]] as is, but modern raids will also throw in boss mechanics into the equation. These are events or minigames that may occur in the middle of the fight. For example, a player might need to periodically run to a pool of antidote to cure the party of lethal poison stacks, or a group of players might have to play an impromptu game of hot potato with a bomb that will explode for massive damage if held too long or dropped. Doing these mechanics often results in a dip in individual role performance, but not doing them would spell disaster for the whole group.\n\n\n## Glue work\n[Glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue) is work outside of your job description that helps the team succeed. Examples of this could be helping with hiring, writing documentation, or jumping into customer calls.\n\n\n## Trade-offs\nDoing things in your job description is like pumping DPS (damage per second) on a boss. You can just keep your head down and knock out tasks one by one. It might not be easy or simple, but it's what you were trained to do. You often get recognized for good performance here and catch flak for bad performance.\n\nDoing \"glue work\" is like doing mechanics. It's critical for your team to succeed, yet it's going to cost you on your DPS performance charts. Hopefully you're in a team that properly appreciates and values it, but it can still feel like you're underperforming.\n\nHowever, I find that doing mechanics helps me understand way more about the nuances of the raid encounter than just pumping DPS, just like how doing glue work helps you understand the business much more holistically than just doing your day to day job. This is similar to how doing projects can teach your more holistic things about your hobbies than just doing the same thing over and over, or how [[doing quests is more rewarding than grinding skills]].\n\nAdditionally, doing mechanics lets me realize and understand the windows during which I can do optimal DPS so that I lose as little as possible. Since more variables are thrown into the mix, this helps me experience more [[edge case|edge cases]] in my play (which is normally [pretty flowcharted](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/unholy-death-knight-pve-dps-rotation-cooldowns-abilities)); taking all of these factors into account has a [[high skill ceiling]]. I hope to get to this state with glue work as well.

The course goes through how to analyze aesthetic fundamentals and apply that to paintings, which is important for [[training intuition]] on how to make art that looks good and communicates intent. There is a scheduled lecture component, ungraded assignments, and an unstructured discussion via [[discord]]. I've found that the most impactful part has been the discussion community; getting feedback and doing the assignments (often multiple times over just for extra practice) with the other students. People would live stream their digital art programs to everyone else, [[working with the garage door open]]. This type of community acted as an [[enabling environment]] for learning and applying the coursework.\n\nHere are my working notes from the class:\n\n## lecture 1\n#### housekeeping\n- abstract = non-representational; abstract exists outside of the visual library\n\t- this course will not step into the representational realm of art!\n- aesthetics = comfort: subconsciously, can i (as the viewer trust) you as a visual communicator?\n- shape hierarchy / big medium small, highlights relationship between objects clearly\n\t- if you make them equal size, need obvious intent otherwise trust is lost\n- topics: shape hierarchy, tangents, cohesion, rest vs. density, shape appeal, tempo, tension\n#### intro: juggling \u0026 intuition\n- putting in reps to these individual building blocks to learn to trust your own intuition\n\t- similar to juggling multible things at once\n- we'll want to make strokes first and analyze them later (rather than while)\n\t- avoid hyper-fixating (almost like a meditative state)\n\t- what WAS my focus like? what WAS my tempo? how can i fine tune this next time?\n\t- get to the point where you'll even be able to do things like hold a conversation while drawing\n#### shape appeal\n- ways to arrange things such that they feel independent, relaxed, pleasant, purposeful. comfort in understanding\n- 90 degree angles signal a \"hard border\" and break up visual engagement\n\t- solidity, impact, stopping of movement/flow\n\t- parallelogram maintains movement of vision more than an equivalent square\n\t- non-parallel lines are appealing because they move into a more or less massive shape as we go along them (shapes/lines have individuality through their relationship)\n\t- you can make equilateral/tangent shapes for the purpose of graphic design and call attention to itself (but it needs to be intentional like that)\n#### tension\n- interest between shapes\n- relationships (this shape is part of that shape, this shape is dominant to that shape, these two shapes are at odds)\n- negative space hierarchy\n\t- discomfort can come from unplanned tension, unwanted combining of objects, flattening of depth\n#### types of tangents\n- kissing tangent: corner of one touches edge of another\n- shared tangent: sharing a line\n- continuation tangent: continued line\n- mirroring/rhythm: one shape mimicking the line of action of another shape\n\t- flattens the depth due to the unplanned relationship / locking them together\n\t- one object steals the information and impact of the other\n\t- reduces trust\n- loss of individuality: two shapes turn into one shape\n- *if something seems like it has a very deliberate reason but there wasn't actually that intention, it damages our feeling of it*\n#### shape exercises\n- afterwards, evaluate based on the concepts each time\n- big/medium/small exercise: first start with 3 shapes\n\t- circles\n\t- boxes\n\t- triangles\n- do them with even more shapes\n\t- gets really complex to maintain rhythm\n\t\t- rhythm: totality with individuality (implies a specific movement while maintaining individual identity)\n\t\t- flow: totality WITHOUT individuality (unified)\n\t- more shapes that can potentially tangent\n#### on randomness\n- feeling of randomness = natural\n\t- randomness != me randomly doing stuff\n\t- gamblers fallacy; flipping heads doesn't mean the next will be tails (random doesn't mean uniform)\n\t- true randomness will have some patterns/clusters of stuff\n\t- this is to avoid distraction and avoid drawing unwanted attention\n#### this stuff seems pretty simple, is it really relevant once i'm really good?\n- becomes more intuitive but never goes away\n- always can find a shape that could be more appealing\n- each block of color/light is a shape and can benefit from shape appeal\n#### patterns\n- an even, cohesive pattern might as well be a blank background (useful when you don't want to draw individual attention, i.e. texture)\n\t- human brain is really good at finding patterns in random stuff\n- a random/chaotic arrangement of different shapes stands out a lot more. this would be really jarring to use as a texture element\n- there will ALWAYS be patterns once you have enough shapes. that's ok\n\t- DO STUFF FIRST, then rely on perception afterward to see which patterns you can try to avoid next time\n\t- benefits are to train the brain and unconscious intuition\n\t- ultimately, if the arrangement \"feels natural\" then that's good. if some part of it doesn't feel natural then we can learn from it and that's also good\n#### final stuff\n- aesthetics are universal and natural\n- aesthetics is a hierarchy and relationship between elements in all kinds of things\n\t- art\n\t- music\n\t- cooking\n\t- etc.\n- intuition is the key to getting in touch with them\n\t- energy, focus, musicality\n#### assignment\n- automatic drawing\n\t- post as many as you want / can!\n- analyze it after\n\t- \"does it feel like i've done some of these concepts we talked about?\"\n\n\n## lecture 2\n#### level of focus\n- we can give awareness and focus to anything\n- try to draw with LESS awareness and focus\n\t- helps you relax\n- then, afterwards, think about your level of awareness and focus\n- rhythms help us break out of overthinking / being overly ambitious, perfectionist, wanting to make it look good\n- automatic drawing is really a proxy for all your drawing - to try and practice these concepts that you can then apply to all your art\n- hard to get to this state of unawareness, even for professionals\n- thats what warmup is for - to get out of that hyperawareness and loosen up. make the perfectionist part of brain wear out\n- forgive yourself for not making a good shape\n\t- if you mess it up at first, you'll eventually do something else and take a different path to something good in the end\n\n#### general feedback from hw\n- starts out with people testing out language, timidly\n- as people start posting more, people get inspired and following that language\n- once you pick up a language, start thinking of how to make that language sound better\n- ppl just vibing and riffing off of each other\n- as we start getting more appealing shape language the brain starts to pick out parts that look like things\n- adding color helps see negative space and notice distracting negative shapes\n\n#### other stuff\n- graffiti has cool angular shapes\n\t- how many times can you write the same letters over and over again?\n- conflict and cohesion both have benefits\n\n#### composition\n- how do we control focal interest?\n- focal points\n- empty space gives feeling of isolation\n\t- can be intended for story/emotion\n\t- if not intended, can crop canvas\n\t- tension / tangents with edge can draw unwanted attention\n- rule of thirds can be good bc if gives you a decent distance to edges and fair balance of negative space\n- primary/secondary/tertiary focal points should have obviously different levels of tension (similar to big medium small)\n- things that increase focus:\n\t- humanity: faces and direction of eyes also command our attention as humans\n\t- color contrast, shape contrast\n\n#### homework exercise: borrowed compositions\n- take any illustration\n\t- look at it first\n\t- find focal points of this image\n\t- sketch out an abstract mapping of attention\n\t- do automated drawing based on that mapping\n\t- balance intent and automation\n- add one flat color to split positive/negative space\n\t- can be white in foreground or background\n\n#### aside: art and adrenaline\n- in high adrenaline, brain takes in everything. no higher thinking functions\n- for art, we make repeating patterns\n- makes lines and curves more symmetrically balanced\n\n#### observe the feelings\n- be aware of feelings like \"ah, these shapes arent appealing\" and keep going\n\t- then, can have more useful observations - \"WHY\" don't i feel good about this?\n- easily switching in and out of automatic/not automatic mode in drawing\n\t- sometimes you need to have hard rules and slip into representative mode\n\t- should get seamless at some point to add in a bit of abstract design spice to a thumbnail\n- it's ok to borrow from someone else's language. especially if you feel stuck\n\n\n## lecture 3\n#### trusting the subconscious\n- rather than \"mindless\" it's more helpful to call it \"trusting of your subconscious\" and tapping into that power\n- there's so much more going on than you think. even when you hear subtle sounds, it only really gets processed in your subconscious (your perception of sounds only actually exists in your head and has to be processed and understood by your brain)\n- it'll be better than most of the conscious decisions you make\n\n#### review on things to improve on composition\n- focal interest\n- hierarchy\n\t- primary secondary focal points\n\t- sides\n\t- big/medium/small\n\n#### demo / homework\n- let's stick to a hard round brush\n\t- can also use lasso and airbrush + alpha lock\n- aside: pressing down too much stresses out your hands. should use delicate pressure sens\n- use size of brush to affect how we render stuff instead of opacity / pen pressure\n\t- should be changing brush size a LOT\n- try to make a silhouette blob with a little bit of hierarchy\n- bring in some weird offset shapes\n\t- offset = angles and pinch points dont line up perfectly to each other\n\t- keep sense of order/structure/hierarchy involved in these shapes\n- do analysis AFTERWARDS and then fix\n- it's more about juggling and try to improve composition rather than being \"perfect\"\n\t- choose the lesser of evils in terms of overwhelming levels of distractions\n\t- OK to drop stuff sometimes\n- can try making things feel extra purposeful by drawing MORE attention to things\n- add creases in places you want to do this\n- respect the implied forms when making new triangles / shadow shapes\n- even in 3 space you can imagine what appeal those shapes would have on a flat paper\n- use lasso + BIG airbrush to build up blobs to practice form rendering\n- then go back to flat round brush and render out the implications of forms\n- dont worry about covering up other stuff to get a good gradation / shape. you can always pretty easily redefine them if you chose to do so\n- create a little punch of contrast, then soften it out except for the intentioned hard edges\n- its ok to go up and down in detail with each stroke\n\t- always going UP in detail gets stale and removes your comfort in ability to make changes and redefine things\n- can start playing with value range to imply materials / specularity\n- final stage: RIM LIGHT! to lock in the forms\n\t- more of a secondary light bc it can bleed in a bit\n\t- try to avoid making consistently thick lines for this\n\t- if it must feel like a line try to make it taper a little bit\n\t- triangle-ey = good\n\t- more muted as you get further from the rim\n- should look good rotated\n- try exercises with different levels of contrast\n\n## lecture 4\n\n(i missed this part of the class lmao)\n\n#### using hue for value\n- not every hue can get as dark as other hues (with same value)\n\t- darker stuff doesnt show saturation as much\n- can move hue wheel just a little bit in one direction (into lighter hues) but it'll stay feeling monochromatic\n\t- then you dont have to inject as much white to make it seem lighter\n\t- dont want to completely rely on injecting white or black to make it look brighter or darker\n\t- this gives your more B4YB (bang for your buck) from your value range\n\n#### importance of loose process\n- dont have to strictly do lineart -\u003e value -\u003e color\n\t- can kind of go back and forth between phases\n\t- e.g. when lines start to go away after value pass can pick some to bring back out and re-emphasize\n\t- it's ok to be a bit chaotic and destroy some of the marks you made\n\t- it's generally easier to clean things up than to make things\n\t- at that stage it's about adapting to the forms you're now looking at and decide if you want to \"refactor\" those lines or just leave them deprecated\n\n#### focal points\n- focal points should form some area between them (not be collinear) but also not waste a lot of area of the form\n- adding stuff is cropping in reverse and can let you change up focal points in ways that make it easier to resolve the other problems\n- of the focal points, make not all of them same hue\n\t- maybe 2 cold 1 warm or 2 warm 1 cold\n\t- or add the opposite temp hue as the rim light\n- have to keep juggling (hue blobs have to have shape design and BMS)\n\n#### ratios and hierarchies\n- 2 things = ratio, 3 things = hierarchy\n\t- more extreme ratio increases drama. 70/30 to 90/10 is about as far as you should go\n- cool / warm | shadow / light | saturated / desaturation are all ratios\n\t- 90/10 works well for saturation\n\n#### backgrounds\n- be aware of how you use the background to make things pop out\n- background can make you \"like\" certain parts a bit more and raise up the whole quality of things\n\n#### graphic complements (includes backgrounds!)\n- something that is visually put in unrelated to everything else just to help create attention in certain areas\n\t- e.g. graphic design element (gradiation, background, box)\n\t- can use it to introduce ratio of organic/inorganic when it wouldnt make sense otherwise\n- these ALSO should follow the design principles we discussed\n\n#### homework: JUGGLING TIME (welcome to the circus)\n\n## lecture 5\n\n#### tying it all together into the real art world\n- so much of it is based on how much you trust yourself\n- instead of juggling it's more like keeping different rhythms at the same time with multiple instruments\n- the moment your brain stops to analyze one hand it is the moment you slip\n- can take a moment AFTER you've made some major shapes\n\n#### main points from homework / things to think about\n- exterior silhouette has evenly spaced chunks\n- pinch points lining up / strong symmetries\n\n#### demo\n- making random bubbles / noise and trying to find the forms (either by outlining silhouette, or blocking out)\n- strands are a nice small place to practice\n- more detail will lose sense of big shapes that were initially in silhouette. big heavy gradiations can help deal with this\n\t- tons of small detail everywhere loses sense of scale\n\t- big areas of rest with some really intricate tiny details results in scale\n\t- aka more contrast between the bigger stuff and smaller stuff\n- re-unification: take a big airbrush and make big sweeping gradiations, then re-build what you to have defined\n\n#### mindset on art improvement\n- \"the way you look at your own art is not the most objective viewpoint on things\"\n- swayed by mental state and psychology and overall sense of self-worth\n- even sinix keeps coming up with new observations on art improvement every year\n\n#### assignment: bring in some representational stuff\n- start pieces abstract, then find little places to turn things representational (while maintaining abstract sensitibilities)\n- bring some of that looseness into everything you do","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.949506004Z","tags":null},"/barriers-to-entry":{"title":"Barriers to entry","content":"\nBarriers to entry are common

Everyone knows how terrifying a blank white page looks. The void stares back at you, daring you to desecrate its pure surface. Anything you type, write, sketch out, or even think about seems unworthy to break its fresh appearance. Once you've gotten into it, though, your experience carries you through. Nothing is ever as hard as starting something new.\n\nThe funny thing is, a blank slate has the most potential of all. It can be anything you want it to be. And that's exactly what's so frightening about it.\n\n## Getting around it\n\nOne way to overcome blank canvas syndrome is to make any kind of mark; some may even advocate for as messy of a mark as possible. It could be just a scratchy doodle, or a blob of paint, or a rough beat-boxed rhythm, or some quick notes about the ideas we want to convey. This \"ruins\" the blank slate and helps put us in a spot (as well as a headspace) where we can figure out the [[gradient of improvement]], from which we can take advantage of [[happy accidents]]. \n\n## For art\nFor the literal blank canvas, I installed this program called [Carapace](https://www.epicgames.com/community/2012/11/free-art-tool-released-thanks-to-epic-friday/), which is a perspective tool created by Epic Games' art department. It is an easy way to generate perspective lines that can be customized and pasted into anything. Seeing the lines helps me visualize what I want to design, and makes me feel less about marking up a clean surface. \n\nYou can get up to, if I remember correctly, 10 vanishing points on one canvas. If you could ever think of a situation where you would need that many.\n\n![[Carapace.png]]\n\nAn interesting approach is the \"marker first\" method. This involves using a very large, low opacity brush (or marker, if you're working in traditional media) to work out the basic forms. [Feng Zhu](https://www.youtube.com/user/FZDSCHOOL) and his design cinema series on YouTube go more into this; his methods of dealing with a blank canvas are quite helpful for those wanting to get into his type of work. \n\nAnother tactic I've used to reduce the intimidation factor on a fresh page is download (and make my own) custom Photoshop brushes that have some kind of texture in them. This helps extract the forms a bit, and works similar to the marker-first method with the added benefit of a bit of texture gifted to us with modern technology. It feels super cool to just lay down a gritty concrete texture, or to generate some foliage just by dragging a brush across the screen. Feng Zhu also talks about using photos in a non-traditional way, by clipping, rotating, and pasting them all across the canvas to generate a sort of random noise that also contains realistic details with the photographic quality of the random shapes. This way you also avoid copyright problems with creative commons, since very little of the original photograph is left over at the end; it becomes nothing more than a texture. Or, of course, you could just use your own photos. If you're cool like that.\n\nI think ultimately the purpose of this is to eliminate the fear of something huge and white staring you in the face, and perhaps even gaining some kind of advantage in the process. There are many ways to get over this, and it all depends on what you're comfortable with. The anxiety goes away once you are comfortable, so the point is to get comfortable. So pull on those sweatpants, sit unflatteringly on that couch, and start dirtying up that blank page to get the creative sodas flowing in.","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.949506004Z","tags":null},"/building-your-village":{"title":"Building your village","content":"\nInhabiting the same physical or virtual spaces can cause [[unplanned repeated interactions]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.949506004Z","tags":null},"/cognitive-scaffolding":{"title":"Cognitive scaffolding","content":"\nhttps://notes.andymatuschak.org/Cognitive_scaffolding","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.949506004Z","tags":null},"/collectors-fallacy":{"title":"Collector's fallacy","content":"\n[Collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/): you really have to work with something to understand it.\nKnowing **about** a thing is not the same thing as knowing it.\n\nCollectors don't make progress.\n\nIn my own life, this rings true- none of my bookmarked pages have done me any good if I never open them.

Generally quests and grinding line up to some degree, but not in [RuneScape](https://play.runescape.com/).\n\nQuests in RS involve talking to a person of interest somewhere in the world and asking if they need help. This will initiate a sequence of tasks to complete around the world until the storyline is resolved, after which the player will receive experience in various skills that were used. Certain levels of various skills are often required to complete a quest, as the tasks can involve using the player's skills to solve a problem. The number of repetitions of the skill to complete the task is relatively low, but it often takes many repetitions to get the skill to the level that allows the player to even begin to perform the task. In this way, these skill requirements become goals or milestones in a player's practice/training in order to complete these tasks for the quest. I would first need to achieve some proficiency in mining in order to extract the ore needed to [help a knight forge a sword out of a particular metal](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Knight%27s_Sword). \n\nIn a way, quests are very similar to projects in the real world. Projects and quests both involve a variety of skills, and those skills require a certain level of mastery to complete. There are some situations where mindlessly grinding is more efficient but often doing projects (questing) is the fastest way to improve. Even when grinding is faster, completing projects breaks down the grind and gives tangible milestones for a real goal with meaningful impacts. This fuels us with motivation to train ourselves to hit these milestones. The increase in stakes can alter our typical [[objective function|reward function]] and help in [[training intuition]]. It gives us [excited accountability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwqVtZn5df8).\n\nIn RS, the XP you get from doing a quest is often much higher than if you grinded that skill repeatedly; just like if you actually apply a skill to a project you'll learn more from the context and from having to finish things from end-to-end. This is similar to how enabling environments require a goal. Completing the quest could also give interesting perks from helping particular groups of people that can help with the related skills in the long run.\n\n[[requirements for a real life quest]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.949506004Z","tags":null},"/dunbars-number":{"title":"Dunbar's Number","content":"\nDunbar's number is the theoretical limit to how many people you can maintain a stable social relationship with, commonly pegged to around 150.

Especially with skills, without context or structured education, we struggle to break down skills into smaller requisite sub-skills, and struggle to prioritize how much effort to allot to these sub-skills and in what order. Essentially, we cannot find the optima and learn the whole skill because we are unable to find the gradient of improvement. This can often be the difficulty in using a [greedy algorithm](greedy%20algorithm.md).\n\nOne way to quickly find the gradient of improvement is to build a [cognitive scaffolding](cognitive%20scaffolding.md) from other developed skills.\n\nThis analogy is also useful when visualizing plateaus and local maxima.

They play a full symphonic arrangement, which we can assume to be the most high-fidelity, accurate representation of the composer's intent. Now, let's drop most of the members of the orchestra; maybe one person per instrumental section. There's still one person to play every single part to get the musical information across accurately, but much of the symphonic \"feel\" is lost. How about if we arrange this piece for a quartet? With 4 musicians, the piece is almost entirely different; yet fundamentally it's the same piece. What about with just one violin soloist with a piano accompaniment? We have reached the minimum number of people that can play this piece and have it still be the same song; the lowest rank approximation possible.\n\nWhen reducing the number of members in a musical group, some information is inevitably lost, and each remaining member must perform more roles in order to express the piece. In the real world, bands often follow a natural convergence at each reduction in members to some ideal minima in low rank approximation. Of course, the direction and nature of reducing rank depends heavily on the genre of music; in essence, the type of data. Take a 6-piece rock band, with a vocalist, 2 guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, and someone on keys. Since it's a rock band, if we had to kick one member we'd kick the pianist. Next, we'd probably teach our vocalist rhythm guitar to go from 5 to 4 members. Generally you don't see bands reduce any below 4, but with some creativity we can replace the drummer and bassist with a DJ to get 3 members. Then, we'd get rid of the lead guitar and toss in some FL Slayer. In fact, we can throw Melodyne on the DJ's vocals and get rid of the singer too!

I even somehow gained a handful of devoted aesthetic rebloggers who would constantly repost my stuff. Who knows how they even found it...\n\nYears later I applied this idea to a beat dump on soundcloud where I'd post music, with an even greater emphasis on those three motivations. The second piece was further empowered by liberal use of private tracks. It became almost a time capsule of sorts for me to go back and listen to how my sound improved and evolved. The timeline view and option to upload album covers gave it an edge over just listening to my own `.wav` files in folders, especially for getting REALLY into how I was thinking and feeling at the time. I could also share tracks with close friends and interact with some form of community on the soundcloud platform (although most of them were clearly poorly disguised bots). It was great. So I posted everything to both this and the art microblog separately for a long time. \n\nHere and there I found myself thinking, why not make a \"Siyang everything dump\" where I just aggregate EVERYTHING I think about or experience or make into one place? Without having to navigate separate platforms or new identities? Where people can find out about the other stuff I do too (slight overshare: this might have come from some unresolved jack-of-all-trades insecurity where I need to prove that I'm decent at a lot of stuff to accept that I'm not amazing at any one thing)?

Maybe the reason everyone turns to microblogging on social media (twitter, instagram, even tiktok) or macroblogging on an actual blog is that it's the way to go. So I'll try it again. The good news is all my notes and notions and obsidians have a ton of unorganized medium-form content that's just itching to get posted. It'll be fun to go through and curate the backfill on that. The nice thing about digital gardens is that I don't have to commit to posts being frozen in time either; I can go back and revisit them as their meaning changes in my life. \n\nAnd then lastly, maybe I don't actually need a centralized place where everything haphazardly gets dumped in its rawest form anyways. Maybe it's good to collect and curate a little, in little bundles like a newspaper or a zine. A show-and-tell of sorts. Art goes on the art website and songs go on the song website, and here's a little collection of the latest of that I've chosen for you with some of my thoughts on them.

If adding a sound for tone, keep the fundamental or low harmonics.\n- This trick also works when taking a melodic sound and extracting its texture by high passing out the fundamental. This is because the higher harmonics (farther from the fundamental) will be more and more atonal.\n\n## Techniques\n- Sweep an EQ cut across the sound while the whole mix plays; cut anything that you didn't notice disappearing\n- Turn gain on sound down a lot, then take an EQ and sweep a boost around to see where it should sit in the mix\n\n## Practice strategy\nTake a low/high pass filter on white noise or any song, and try to blind guess what frequency range the cut is at. This can help [[training intuition|train intuition]] for what certain frequency ranges sound like.","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.957506063Z","tags":null},"/unplanned-repeated-interactions":{"title":"Unplanned repeated interactions","content":"\nSocial [[happy accidents]]\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T06:59:47.957506063Z","tags":null},"/using-depth-models-to-generate-post-processing-fog":{"title":"Using depth models to generate post-processing fog","content":"\nWith neural networks it's now possible to [generate a depth map from any image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03901.pdf).
