Generally quests and grinding line up to some degree, but not in [RuneScape](https://play.runescape.com/).\n\nQuests in RS involve talking to a person of interest somewhere in the world and asking if they need help. This will initiate a sequence of tasks to complete around the world until the storyline is resolved, after which the player will receive experience in various skills that were used. Certain levels of various skills are often required to complete a quest, as the tasks can involve using the player's skills to solve a problem. The number of repetitions of the skill to complete the task is relatively low, but it often takes many repetitions to get the skill to the level that allows the player to even begin to perform the task. In this way, these skill requirements become goals or milestones in a player's practice/training in order to complete these tasks for the quest. I would first need to achieve some proficiency in mining in order to extract the ore needed to [help a knight forge a sword out of a particular metal](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Knight%27s_Sword). \n\nIn a way, quests are very similar to projects in the real world. Projects and quests both involve a variety of skills, and those skills require a certain level of mastery to complete. There are some situations where mindlessly grinding is more efficient but often doing projects (questing) is the fastest way to improve. Even when grinding is faster, completing projects breaks down the grind and gives tangible milestones for a real goal with meaningful impacts. This fuels us with motivation to train ourselves to hit these milestones. The increase in stakes can alter our typical [objective function](notes/reward-function) and help in [training our intuition](notes/training-intuition). It gives us [excited accountability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwqVtZn5df8).\n\nIn RS, the XP you get from doing a quest is often much higher than if you grinded that skill repeatedly; just like if you actually apply a skill to a project you'll learn more from the context and from having to finish things from end-to-end. This is similar to how enabling environments require a goal. Completing the quest could also give interesting perks from helping particular groups of people that can help with the related skills in the long run.\n\n[Requirements for a real-life quest](notes/requirements-for-a-real-life-quest)",lastmodified:"2022-03-21T05:28:33.92769095Z",title:"Doing quests is more rewarding than grinding skills"},"/notes/edge-case":{content:"When building models or algorithms, we construct a space which contains the expected behavior and tailor our models to that space. Edge cases can occur in the real world, existing at or past the boundary of what's expected and what we prepared for. Edge cases can also be unique combinations of variables that interact in a way that we didn't think of (this is often called a [corner case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case)), or variables we didn't consider entirely.\n\nHumans with unique circumstances or experiences can become [living edge cases](notes/living-edge-case).",lastmodified:"2022-03-21T05:28:33.92769095Z",title:"Edge case"},"/notes/gradient-of-improvement":{content:"In mathematics, a gradient is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest descent/ascent. The magnitude of the vector is how steep the slope is, and so the gradient is the vector with the largest magnitude, or in other words the largest change. If we want to find the highest point in a topography (the maximum of the [objective function](notes/objective-function)), one approach is to always follow the direction of the steepest gradient, which will lead us to the local maximum faster than other methods.\n\nThe largest hurdle when working on a new project or learning a new skill is where to go first. Especially with skills, without context or structured education, we struggle to break down skills into smaller requisite sub-skills, and struggle to prioritize how much effort to allot to these sub-skills and in what order. Essentially, we cannot find the optima and learn the whole skill because we are unable to find the gradient of improvement. This can often be the difficulty in using a [greedy algorithm](notes/greedy-algorithm).\n\nOne way to quickly find the gradient of improvement is to build a [cognitive scaffolding](notes/cognitive-scaffolding) from other developed skills.\n\nThis analogy is also useful when visualizing plateaus and local maxima. Just like in mathematical optimization, we require a more sophisticated method to get out of plateaus and local maxima which may involve temporarily reducing our level of skill to go in the right direction.

They play a full symphonic arrangement, which we can assume to be the most high-fidelity, accurate representation of the composer's intent. Now, let's drop most of the members of the orchestra; maybe one person per instrumental section. There's still one person to play every single part to get the musical information across accurately, but much of the symphonic \"feel\" is lost. How about if we arrange this piece for a quartet? With 4 musicians, the piece is almost entirely different; yet fundamentally it's the same piece. What about with just one violin soloist with a piano accompaniment? We have reached the minimum number of people that can play this piece and have it still be the same song; the lowest rank approximation possible.\n\nWhen reducing the number of members in a musical group, some information is inevitably lost, and each remaining member must perform more roles in order to express the piece. In the real world, bands often follow a natural convergence at each reduction in members to some ideal minima in low rank approximation. Of course, the direction and nature of reducing rank depends heavily on the genre of music; in essence, the type of data. Take a 6-piece rock band, with a vocalist, 2 guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, and someone on keys. Since it's a rock band, if we had to kick one member we'd kick the pianist. Next, we'd probably teach our vocalist rhythm guitar to go from 5 to 4 members. Generally you don't see bands reduce any below 4, but with some creativity we can replace the drummer and bassist with a DJ to get 3 members. Then, we'd get rid of the lead guitar and toss in some FL Slayer. In fact, we can throw Melodyne on the DJ's vocals and get rid of the singer too!

Each of these adventurers will have their own specialized role in the team. Within the typical [MMO Holy Trinity](https://kionay.medium.com/what-is-the-mmo-holy-trinity-85b800fabc3f) we have a tank that gets the attention of the boss and protects the party, damage dealers who try to down the boss as fast as possible, and supportive healers who try to keep everyone else alive. Playing one's own role can be difficult to optimize and have a [high skill ceiling](notes/high-skill-ceiling) as is, but modern raids will also throw in boss mechanics into the equation. These are events or minigames that may occur in the middle of the fight. For example, a player might need to periodically run to a pool of antidote to cure the party of lethal poison stacks, or a group of players might have to play an impromptu game of hot potato with a bomb that will explode for massive damage if held too long or dropped. Doing these mechanics often results in a dip in individual role performance, but not doing them would spell disaster for the whole group.\n\n\n## Glue work\n[Glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue) is work outside of your job description that helps the team succeed. Examples of this could be helping with hiring, writing documentation, or jumping into customer calls.\n\n\n## Trade-offs\nDoing things in your job description is like pumping DPS (damage per second) on a boss. You can just keep your head down and knock out tasks one by one. It might not be easy or simple, but it's what you were trained to do. You often get recognized for good performance here and catch flak for bad performance.\n\nDoing \"glue work\" is like doing mechanics. It's critical for your team to succeed, yet it's going to cost you on your DPS performance charts. Hopefully you're in a team that properly appreciates and values it, but it can still feel like you're underperforming.\n\nHowever, I find that doing mechanics helps me understand way more about the nuances of the raid encounter than just pumping DPS, just like how doing glue work helps you understand the business much more holistically than just doing your day to day job. This is similar to how doing projects can teach your more holistic things about your hobbies than just doing the same thing over and over, or how [doing quests is more rewarding than grinding skills](notes/doing-quests-is-more-rewarding-than-grinding-skills).\n\nAdditionally, doing mechanics lets me realize and understand the windows during which I can do optimal DPS so that I lose as little as possible.

EQ cuts create definition\n- EQ cuts cause separation between parts of the spectrum. This causes parts on either side of the cut to pop out more. \n- This means you can cut on both sides instead of boosting to reach the same effect while giving more headroom to push saturation. \n- You can cut strategically around a region in order to boost that part of the sound even more while retaining clarity\n\n#### 2. Know what part of the sound you do and don\'t need\n- Always consider the sound in context of the mix. A guitar without any EQ cuts in the low mids / mids might sound really good and full on its own, but when mixed in with other melodic elements it can contribute to a muddy mix. \n- Be aware of what the sound is contributing and only keep that part; if adding a sound for timbre, cut out anything but the high end and other elements can fill in the gaps. If adding a sound for tone, keep the fundamental or low harmonics.\n- This trick also works when taking a melodic sound and extracting its texture by high passing out the fundamental. This is because the higher harmonics (farther from the fundamental) will be more and more atonal.\n\n## Techniques\n- Sweep an EQ cut across the sound while the whole mix plays; cut anything that you didn\'t notice disappearing\n- Turn gain on sound down a lot, then take an EQ and sweep a boost around to see where it should sit in the mix\n\n## Practice strategy\nTake a low/high pass filter on white noise or any song, and try to blind guess what frequency range the cut is at. This can help [train intuition](notes/training-intuition) for what certain frequency ranges sound like.',lastmodified:"2022-03-21T05:28:33.935690935Z",title:"Understanding equalization"},"/notes/unplanned-repeated-interactions":{content:"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html",lastmodified:"2022-03-21T05:28:33.935690935Z",title:"Unplanned repeated interactions"},"/notes/using-depth-models-to-generate-post-processing-fog":{content:"With neural networks it's now possible to [generate a depth map from any image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03901.pdf).
